My name is <b>Ali</b>, full name is <b>Muhammadali Uralov</b>, and I am a developer of telegram bots. Actually, my goal is to become a Fullstack developer, but for some reason I started my career in the field of bot development. At the moment I know <b>Java</b> (basic), <b>Python</b> (medium), <b>Aiogram framework</b> (medium). I've been actively developing bots lately. I developed my own pet project, a bot for the bank, and so on. I learned a lot of things during the development process.

But to be honest, lately I feel like it's all a waste of time. I don't know why. I was looking for vacancies in this field, but I never found one, so I'm thinking of switching to web development
